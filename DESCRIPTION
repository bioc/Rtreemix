Description: Rtreemix is a package that offers an environment for
        estimating the mutagenetic trees mixture models from
        cross-sectional data and using them for various predictions. It
        includes functions for fitting the trees mixture models,
        likelihood computations, model comparisons, waiting time
        estimations, stability analysis, etc.
